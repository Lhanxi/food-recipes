    <h1>Pan-Seared Steak</h1>
     <img src="../images/Steak.jpg"alt="Picture of Steak">
     <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. </p>
     <p>This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because itâ€™s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is <strong>lip-smacking</strong> good!</p>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pat dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Season generously - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just <em>1/2 Tbsp</em> oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks - add steaks and sear each side <em>3-4 minutes</em> until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (<em>1 min</em> per edge).</li>
        <li>Add butter and aromatics - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness</li>
        <li>Remove steak and rest <em>10 minutes</em>  before slicing against the grain.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Steak Doneness</h3>
